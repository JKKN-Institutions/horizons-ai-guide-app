  // Stage 1: What Even Is Entrepreneurship? (Lessons 1-15)
  { id: 1, stage: 1, title: 'What Is Entrepreneurship, Really?', content: 'Entrepreneurship isn\'t about having money or a fancy office. It\'s about solving problems. Every successful business started because someone noticed a problem and thought, "I can fix this." Dhirubhai Ambani started by selling spices. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw started Biocon in her garage. The common thread? They saw problems others ignored.', microTask: 'Write down 3 problems you faced today — big or small. Could any of them be a business?', reflection: 'What does entrepreneurship mean to you after this lesson?', category: 'Mindset' },
  { id: 2, stage: 1, title: 'Myths That Stop You From Starting', content: '"You need money to start." FALSE — WhatsApp was built by 2 people. "You need to be a genius." FALSE — most successful founders are persistent, not brilliant. "You need to be old enough." FALSE — Tilak Mehta started Paper n Parcels at 13. Let\'s bust every myth holding you back.', microTask: 'Ask 3 family members what they think about starting a business. Write down their myths.', reflection: 'Which myth were YOU believing before this lesson?', category: 'Mindset' },
  { id: 3, stage: 1, title: 'The Problem-Solver Mindset', content: 'Entrepreneurs don\'t create products — they solve problems. Netflix solved "I hate going to video stores." Ola solved "I can\'t find a reliable auto/cab." Swiggy solved "I want restaurant food at home." Your job: become someone who SEES problems everywhere.', microTask: 'Observe one business near your school today. What problem does it solve? Who are its customers?', reflection: 'Can you start seeing problems as opportunities?', category: 'Mindset' },
  { id: 4, stage: 1, title: 'Entrepreneur vs Employee: Two Valid Paths', content: 'Neither path is "better." But they\'re fundamentally different. Employees trade time for money with predictable income. Entrepreneurs trade problems for value with unpredictable but unlimited income. Understanding which energizes YOU is critical.', microTask: 'List 3 things that excite you about creating something new vs 3 things about job security.', reflection: 'Which list excites you more? Be honest — both answers are okay.', category: 'Self-Discovery' },
  { id: 5, stage: 1, title: 'Your Entrepreneurial Personality Type', content: 'Are you a Builder (loves creating systems), a Hustler (loves selling and networking), a Visionary (sees the future), or an Analyst (loves data and optimization)? Most successful startups need all four. Knowing YOUR type helps you find the right co-founder.', microTask: 'Take the quick personality quiz and discover your entrepreneurial type.', reflection: 'Were you surprised by your result? Why or why not?', category: 'Self-Discovery' },
  { id: 6, stage: 1, title: 'Indian Founders Who Started With Nothing', content: 'Ritesh Agarwal (OYO) dropped out at 17 and started with ₹0 investment. Bhavish Aggarwal (Ola) started with a bad cab experience. Falguni Nayar left a banking job at 50 to start Nykaa. Age, money, background — none of these define your potential.', microTask: 'Pick one founder from today\'s lesson. Research one more fact about them not mentioned here.', reflection: 'What\'s the ONE thing these founders have in common?', category: 'Inspiration' },
  { id: 7, stage: 1, title: 'What Makes a Good Business Idea?', content: 'A good idea solves a REAL problem for REAL people who will PAY for a solution. Three filters: 1) Is the problem frequent and painful? 2) Are people already trying to solve it (badly)? 3) Can you do it better/cheaper/faster? If yes to all three, you might have something.', microTask: 'Pick one problem from your Day 1 list. Apply the three filters. Does it pass?', reflection: 'Why do most "good ideas" fail these three simple filters?', category: 'Ideation' },
  { id: 8, stage: 1, title: 'The Lean Startup: Build → Measure → Learn', content: 'Eric Ries changed everything with one idea: don\'t build the full product first. Build the SMALLEST version, measure if people want it, learn from the data, and repeat. This saves months of work and lakhs of rupees. Even Google started as a single search page.', microTask: 'Think of your favorite app. What was probably its simplest first version?', reflection: 'How does "start small" change how you think about starting?', category: 'Framework' },
  { id: 9, stage: 1, title: 'Local Problems = Global Opportunities', content: 'Zomato started solving a local problem in Delhi (restaurant menus). PhonePe started solving UPI adoption in India. Your neighbourhood problem might be faced by millions. India\'s biggest advantage: 1.4 billion people = 1.4 billion opportunities.', microTask: 'Walk around your neighbourhood.

You\'re ready for Stage 2: Finding problems worth solving.', microTask: 'Write a 5-line "Entrepreneurship Manifesto" — your personal commitment to this journey.', reflection: 'On a scale of 1-10, how ready do you feel to continue?', category: 'Review' },

  // Stage 2: How Do I Find a Problem Worth Solving? (Lessons 11-25)
  { id: 11, stage: 2, title: 'The Art of Observation', content: 'Most people walk past problems without noticing. Entrepreneurs LOOK for them. Today\'s exercise: spend 15 minutes at a local shop, bus stop, or market. Don\'t buy anything — just WATCH. What frustrates people? What takes too long? What\'s confusing?', microTask: 'Spend 15 minutes observing a public place. Write down every frustration you notice.', reflection: 'How many problems did you find that you\'d never noticed before?', category: 'Discovery' },
  { id: 12, stage: 2, title: 'Customer Interviews 101', content: 'The #1 rule of entrepreneurship: NEVER assume you know what people want. ASK them. But asking "Would you buy my product?" gives useless answers (everyone says yes). Instead ask: "Tell me about the last time you faced [problem]. What did you do?"', microTask: 'Interview one person about a problem they face. Use the "Tell me about the last time..." format.', reflection: 'What surprised you about what they said vs what you expected?', category: 'Research' },
  { id: 13, stage: 2, title: 'The 10x Problem Framework', content: 'Not all problems are worth solving. Use this framework: Frequency (daily > monthly), Intensity (painful > annoying), Current solutions (bad > good), Technology advantage (possible > impossible), Market size (large > tiny). Score each problem 1-5 on these dimensions.', microTask: 'Score 3 problems from your observation list using the 10x Framework.', reflection: 'Which problem scored highest? Were you surprised?', category: 'Framework' },
  { id: 14, stage: 2, title: 'Must-Have vs Nice-to-Have', content: 'Painkillers sell better than vitamins. A "must-have" solves a problem people NEED solved (medical delivery, school transport). A "nice-to-have" is something people MIGHT use (another photo filter app). Build painkillers, not vitamins.', microTask: 'Classify your top 3 problems as "painkiller" or "vitamin." Be ruthlessly honest.', reflection: 'Why do most first-time entrepreneurs build vitamins instead of painkillers?', category: 'Validation' },
  { id: 15, stage: 2, title: 'Your Personal Problem Bank', content: 'Every great entrepreneur maintains a "Problem Bank" — a running list of problems they\'ve observed, researched, and validated. By the end of this stage, you should have 20-30 problems documented with observations, interviews, and 10x scores.', microTask: 'Start your Problem Bank document. Add at least 5 problems with their 10x scores.', reflection: 'Looking at your Problem Bank, which problems energize you the most?', category: 'Portfolio' },

  // Stage 3: Turning Problems Into Ideas (Lessons 16-25)
  { id: 16, stage: 3, title: 'From Problem to Solution: Ideation Techniques', content: 'Now that you have validated problems, it\'s time to brainstorm solutions. Use "How Might We" (HMW) questions: "How might we help students find affordable textbooks?" generates better ideas than "textbook app." Generate 10+ ideas per problem — quantity before quality.', microTask: 'Pick your top problem. Write 10 "How Might We" solutions. Don\'t judge any of them yet.', reflection: 'Which of your 10 ideas excites you most? Which seems most practical?', category: 'Ideation' },
  { id: 17, stage: 3, title: 'The Business Model Canvas Explained', content: 'The Business Model Canvas is a one-page blueprint for any business. 9 blocks: Customer Segments, Value Proposition, Channels, Customer Relationships, Revenue Streams, Key Resources, Key Activities, Key Partners, Cost Structure.

Label each box.', reflection: 'How does seeing a business as 9 connected blocks change your thinking?', category: 'Framework' },
  { id: 18, stage: 3, title: 'MVP: Your Minimum Viable Product', content: 'An MVP is the simplest version of your product that lets you test if people actually want it. Dropbox\'s MVP was a video. Zappos\' MVP was photos of shoes from a local store. Food delivery MVPs were phone calls and bikes. You don\'t need an app — you need proof people will pay.', microTask: 'Design an MVP for your top idea that costs ₹0 and takes less than 1 week to test.', reflection: 'What\'s the absolute minimum you need to test if people want your solution?', category: 'Building' },
  { id: 19, stage: 3, title: 'Unit Economics: Will You Make Money?', content: 'Unit economics = what you earn from ONE customer minus what it costs to serve ONE customer. If you earn ₹60 per delivery but it costs ₹40 in rider pay + ₹15 in packaging = ₹5 profit per order. You need 2000 orders/month to make ₹10,000. Can you get 2000 orders?', microTask: 'Calculate the unit economics for your business idea. Revenue per customer - Cost per customer = ?', reflection: 'Is your unit economics positive? If not, what needs to change?', category: 'Finance' },
  { id: 20, stage: 3, title: 'Stage 3 Review: Your Validated Idea', content: 'Checkpoint: Do you have a clear problem with a 10x score? A solution that people actually want? An MVP you can build in a week? Positive unit economics (or a path to it)? If yes, you have a validated business idea. That puts you ahead of 80% of aspiring entrepreneurs.', microTask: 'Write a one-paragraph summary of your validated business idea: Problem → Solution → Customer → Revenue.', reflection: 'How confident are you that people would pay for this?', category: 'Review' },
